# Unittesting-Mock-Employee
This is a simple program designed to display some knowledge of Unittesting. 
Along with Unittesting it comes with a Mock test so that external dependencies wouldn't affect certain tests.
In this case, we do a mocking test in case if we were to go to a random website and the website is down for some reason. 
We don't want a test fail because a website is down which is out of one's control, but because of our code's behavior rather.
The Unittesting aspect is which we have 2 objects creating at the start in which they have a first and last name. Once the object is created they are test as they should have an email with their first and last name.
